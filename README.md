#  MARL

A modular **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** system built using **PettingZoo** and **PyTorch**, designed for **cooperative multi-agent environments**. The current implementation provides a working baseline of **Independent Q-Learning (IQL)** and serves as a foundation for more advanced MARL approaches.

---

##  Features

- âœ… Environment wrapper for PettingZoo (`simple_spread_v3`)
- âœ… Modular agent architecture (`BaseAgent`, `IQLAgent`)
- âœ… Centralized training script with logging and plotting
- âœ… Epsilon-greedy exploration
- âœ… Target network updates
- âœ… Replay buffer for experience reuse
- ðŸ“ˆ Reward visualization (`matplotlib`)
- ðŸ§© Extensible design for future algorithms (QMIX, MADDPG, etc.)

## ðŸŽ¯ Algorithm: Independent Q-Learning (IQL)

Each agent:
- Trains independently using DQN-like architecture.
- Uses its **own observations** and **Q-network** to select actions.
- Maintains its own replay buffer and updates via Q-learning.

> **Goal**: Learn policies that let agents cooperatively reach landmarks in `simple_spread_v3`.
