# marl_project
A modular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system designed for cooperative, competitive, and mixed interaction settings using the PettingZoo library. This project provides a functional baseline implementation with Independent Q-Learning (IQL) and is designed to be extended into advanced MARL architectures like QMIX, MADDPG, and learned communication protocols.
